    "# PALANTIR IN A BOX - USING AGENTIC AI FOR INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how **Agentic AI** has the potential to transform the intelligence cycle, acting as a high-speed force multiplier for human analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an AI partner that does more than just search — it *reasons*. Starting with a simple natural language query, this system autonomously navigates a curated knowledge base, executes the well-known **Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)** structured analysis technique and, finally, synthesizes a professional Intelligence Report.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output delivers value at every level:\n",
    "*   **Executive Summary:** The \"Bottom Line Up Front\" (BLUF).\n",
    "*   **Transparent Tradecraft:** A complete audit trail of the ACH execution and evidence weighting.\n",
    "*   **Strategic Edge:** Concrete, actionable recommendations derived from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have designed this system with a specific philosophy: **High impact, safe boundaries.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Safety First:** To prevent the proliferation of a foundation for unchecked, high-grade artificial intelligence capabilities, the system is purposefully constrained to a TRL-3 prototype level. Sources were curated manually and the **analytical domain for the system has been artificially narrowed down**.\n",
    "*   **Engineered for Stability:** We prioritize reliability over complexity. By replacing unpredictable supervisor agents with **robust programmatic workflows**, the system delivers consistent performance on lightweight, cost-effective models like `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Result:** A powerful demonstration of structured intelligence analysis that is safe, accessible, and surprisingly capable — even within strict architectural limits.\n",
    "\n",

    "> **⚠️ Legal Disclaimer**\n",
    "> This project is an independent educational prototype and is **not** affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Palantir Technologies Inc. The title *\"Palantir in a Box\"* is used purely metaphorically to describe high-level intelligence analysis capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **⚠️ Operational Note**\n",
    "> Due to the inherent variability of Generative AI and potential API load, the execution of AI Agents may occasionally be unpredictable or fail. If the process stalls or encounters an error, **restarting the kernel and re-running the notebook** will usually resolve the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **⚠️ Model Behavior**\n",
    "> This system utilizes lightweight models (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`) to maintain speed and basically run at no cost. As a result, outputs may occasionally be **unpredictable, incomplete or hallucinatory**. If the analysis seems \"off\" or lacks depth, please **restart the kernel and re-run the notebook**. Due to the stochastic nature of these models, a follow up attempt often yields significantly higher-quality results."
