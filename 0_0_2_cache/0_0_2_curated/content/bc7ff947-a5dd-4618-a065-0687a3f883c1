The question of Ukraine’s future has become a question about the future of Europe, and indeed about the future of the international order. Ukraine is a large country with a population of more than 40 million. Its defeat would alter the balance of power in Europe, whether or not Russia annexed its territory. The most important thing to understand is that Ukraine is not a state like Kosovo or Montenegro, and its experience is not like that of the Czech Republic or Poland. If Russia were to conquer Ukraine, it would also mean the end of the post-Cold War order and the rise of a new era of great-power politics.

It is easy to imagine a world in which Russia wins in Ukraine. The country’s military is larger and better equipped than Ukraine’s. Russia’s population is also much larger than Ukraine’s, and it has more resources. A Russian victory would likely mean that Ukraine would be partitioned between Russia and the West. Russia would annex eastern Ukraine, and the West would annex western Ukraine. Ukraine would cease to exist as an independent state.

This scenario would have profound implications for the rest of Europe. Russia would be emboldened by its victory and would likely seek to expand its influence further into Eastern Europe. NATO would be forced to respond, and a new Cold War could ensue. The economic consequences would also be severe. The war in Ukraine has already disrupted global energy markets, and a Russian victory would only exacerbate these problems.

However, it is also possible that Russia could lose in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military has been surprisingly effective, and the Ukrainian people have shown a strong will to resist. If Russia were to be defeated, it would likely lead to a period of instability in Russia itself. Putin's regime could collapse, and a new era of Russian history could begin.

This scenario would also have profound implications for Europe. A weakened Russia would be less of a threat to its neighbors, and NATO could focus on other issues. The economic consequences would also be positive. A resolution to the conflict in Ukraine would lead to a decrease in energy prices and a boost to global trade.

Ultimately, the outcome of the war in Ukraine is uncertain. However, it is clear that the stakes are high. The future of Ukraine, and indeed the future of Europe, hangs in the balance.
